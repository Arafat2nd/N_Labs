N-Labs is a comprehensive software solution designed to assist with the organization and management of labs and practical courses within a department. It aims to streamline academic and administrative processes for both students and faculty members. The platform includes features such as the submission of reports, grading, sharing of learning materials, tracking of lab resources and tools, and much more.

The project initially began as a course requirement for a database management systems class, however, I have since expanded upon its core concepts and ideas to continue learning and growing as a developer.

**The project will be divided into three distinct phases:**

**Phase 1: Java application.**

Phase 1, Java application: This phase has been completed, but I am still working on applying bug fixes and organizing the source code for better readability.

**Phase 2: Java application with a Flutter mobile application.**

I am currently working on this phase, which aims to provide a light mobile version of the application developed with Flutter, while still using MySQL to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

**Phase 3: Flutter application with Firebase.**

This final phase of the project will utilize the power of Flutter to provide localization support for all platforms, making it the culmination of my journey and efforts so far. The use of Firebase will allow me to handle the backend operation more easily and efficiently.

I am excited to see the final result of my efforts and to continue learning and growing as a developer.

Some sneak peeks from phase 1:
